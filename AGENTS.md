# HarmonyBot rules for Codex

* This is the only AGENTS.md file in the repository

* dotnet (.NET 9) should be installed, if not found the dotnet root is: /root/.dotnet

* Respect .editorconfig when doing edits, especially for using whitespace

* Whitespace rules are TAB, CRLF endings. Longer than usual lines (~ 140 chars are ok)

* User dotnet format to format the code - it will respect the .editorconfig file.
